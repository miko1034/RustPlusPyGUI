# RustPlusPyProject
A python made Rust+ project thingy I am working on because computing teacher is setting boring work




Add you info into the serverInfo.txt file. You can get the server ip and the unique player token by getting the Rustplus.py Link Companion. 
Just install the extention, log in, and press "Listen for notifications".
Now when you go in game and link a server whilst having this tab open, you will get an additional box that shows up. It will contain details from the server.
Copy the 'playerToken' value, and paste it into the serverInfo.txt and copy the 'ip' value and paste it into the serverInfo.txt file.

Now you can run the program!
Run main.py

Enjoy!
